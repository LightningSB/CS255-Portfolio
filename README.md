# CS255-Portfolio

The DriverPass project was a venture to create a comprehensive system for a driving school business. The client for this project was the owner of DriverPass, who needed a multifaceted system designed to handle various aspects of their operations, including scheduling driving lessons, managing vehicle and driver assignments, tracking customer progress, and handling payments and package offerings.

In designing this system, one aspect that I handled particularly well was ensuring that the system the overall understanding of the system's structure and imagining what the system would look like if I were to actually build it.

If I had to choose one part of my work to revise, it would be the class diagram. I would focus on clearly illustrating the relationships and dependencies between different classes to ensure a better understanding of how each component interacts within the system. Improvements would include more detailed associations and possibly adding interface classes to depict system functionality more accurately.

To interpret the user's needs, I closely examined the roles of different stakeholders, like the Owner, Secretary, and Customers, and what tasks they needed to perform. These needs were then translated into features and functions within the system, ensuring that each user interaction was as seamless and efficient as possible. Considering the user's needs is paramount because it directly affects the usability and adoption of the system. A system that aligns well with user expectations will likely see higher satisfaction and fewer errors, leading to a successful implementation.
